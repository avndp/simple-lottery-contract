# A simple lottery contract (Ethereum) with basic front end (Vanilla JS)

- App is simple. Takes amount as input and enters into the lottery contract. The manager can pick a random winner, who gets all the contract balance.

- App is written in Vanilla Javascript. 

- I was frustrated to get a working Web3 connection due to the recent changes. Finally, this works (as on August, 2021) with MetaMask without any errors.
