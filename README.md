# A simple lottery contract (Ethereum) with basic front end (Vanilla JS)

- App is simple. Takes amount as input and enters into the lottery contract. The manager can pick a random winner, who gets all the contract balance.

- App is written in Vanilla Javascript. 

- I was frustrated to get a working Web3 connection due to the recent changes. Finally, this works (as on August, 2021) with MetaMask without any errors.

# How to build?

- Clone the repo.
- Compile and Deploy the contract (code in lottery.sol file) using Remix (https://remix.ethereum.org/) on to the Rinkeby Testnet. 
- Replace the contract address in app.js file.
- Run the index.html file and there you go!
